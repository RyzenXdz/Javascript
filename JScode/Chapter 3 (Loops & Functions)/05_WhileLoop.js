/* The While Loop Is A Brother Of For Loop But The Difference Is If While Loop Never Became Falase It Will Became An Infinite Loop*/

// For Example:

  let n = 10

  let i = 0

  while(n > i){
    console.log(i)
    i = i + 1
  }

/* Do While Loop */

let ii = 0

let a = 3

do{
  console.log(i)
  ii = ii + 1
}while(ii < a)
